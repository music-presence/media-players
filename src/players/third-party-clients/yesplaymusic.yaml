# FIXME This player has nested represents relationships:
# This player represents
# - netease-cloud-music and
# - netease-cloud-music-zh-placeholder
# but netease-cloud-music also represents:
# - netease-cloud-music-zh-placeholder
# It would be better to not duplicate this.
# But the problem only occurs because of the necessity for a placeholder.
